Xuanmao Li is a graduate stundent in Cornell University Now.My Research interestes are in Large Language Model and Machine Learning.
I am captivated by the boundless possibilities of Large Language Models—these modern bards of computation that craft meaning from the raw essence of data. My primary research passion lies in applying LLMs across diverse tasks and pushing them toward ever-greater efficiencies. In particular, I’m enchanted by the science—and art—of harnessing data in smarter ways to sharpen our models’ performances, whether during the initial training process or in the process of fine-tuning.
